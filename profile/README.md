# Hello, ~my~ *our* name is SNUG
We are a small group of Nix enthusiasts from many different parts of the world, trying to contribute back to one of our favorite ecosystems.

# What do we do?
We mostly chat about topics around and beyond the [*nix package manager*](https://nixos.org/), and it's accompanying Linux distribution NixOS.


# Top Projects

## [Hjem Rum](https://github.com/snugnug/hjem-rum)
A Home Manager-like module system built on top of [Hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem).

## [MicrOS](https://github.com/snugnug/micros)
A small operating system, aiming to bring NixOS-like declarativity to embedded systems.

## [sherpa](https://github.com/snugnug/sherpa)
WIP effort to provide a beginner-friendly guide to the world of Nix and NixOS.

# How can you join?
As a user group, we are always open for new members.
Currently, the only way to join us is via our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6rMPtKDKzt).
A Matrix server is also actively being considered, however interest currently isn't large enough for it to be a viable option.
If discord isn't an option for you, and you still want to contribute, there is nothing preventing you from opening a pull request!
