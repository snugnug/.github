# Outline/TL;DR

A __3-layered__ governance model consisting of:
1. Do-ocracy;
2. Discussion & Consensus; and
3. An elected delegation to resolve disputes.

# The Process
## Method 1: The Do-ocracy

The Do-ocratic method maximizes autonomy within the NUG, ensuring that members who seek to *do,* may *do.* This method should be preferred. By reserving more bureaucratic methods of decision-making for actions that may affect other members of the NUG's work, we minimize endless decision-making and the infighting it brings, and speed along the work and development of the NUG.

Inevitably, however, a pure do-ocratic system could fragment the NUG, and thus, to preserve unity, members may seek to open a discussion on any actions done do-ocratically, as described below.

## Method 2: A discussion-based informal consensus

The discussion may be incited on one of two primary grounds:

1. A member wishes to propose an action said member believes requires group discussion and agreement; or
2. A member seeks to address an action or decision performed do-ocratically.

In either case, the procedure is as follows:

### __Stage 1__: Proposal
The medium of the proposal would likely take the place of a forum thread created with an explanation of the proposal. The body of this explanation should consist of relevant details such as, but not limited to: the problem the proposal aims to solve; how it does so; and what questions and possibly alternatives may be considered. 

### __Stage 2__: Discussion
Questions may be raised, discussed, and answered; criticisms may be levied and responded to; and expansions or changes may be suggested and considered. This stage would make up the bulk of any decision, undergoing consideration in proportion to the severity of the decision. Ultimately, this stage should address any grievous complaints members have with the proposal.

### __Stage 3__: Idle Consensus
Once the conversation has been resolved, a member may propose the finalization of the decision. Barring any objections, the thread will close upon sufficient idle time. There may not be full agreement---that is acceptable. The goal is not for everyone to get their way, but rather, for the decision reached to be acceptable to all. 

Sometimes, however, a decision may not be agreed upon, or a person may simply be a contrarian refusing to compromise. In these cases, we turn to the final method, described below.

## Method 3: Delegated Authority

Discussion may not always reach consensus, particularly in open-source development communities. Yet, there must still be some method to finalizing a decision. To this end, the NUG may elect a three-person delegation with a term limit of 2 by ranked choice voting that ideally represents separate portions of the NUG with the special authority to:

1. Judge when the discussion-based informal consensus method has failed;
2. Decide whether the final decision will be reached by the delegation itself or through other, more democratic means; and
3. Finalize the decision through the means decided upon by the delegation.

The size of three has been chosen because: given the delegation's relatively minor power, a relatively small number is more appropriate; its size must be an odd number to avoid ties within the delegation; and a delegation of one would simply be too small, with power too concentrated, with too little representative capability.

# Conclusion
By fragmenting the decision-making between these three methods, we can maximize the surface area of the ideal method(s) and minimize coercive authority while still ensuring that the procedures neither break down nor stymie the NUG's work or development.
